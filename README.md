# Movie-recommendation

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can recommend movies to users.
The model will be based on a content-based recommendation approach, which focuses on the features of the movies rather than on user behavior or collaborative filtering.

Once the dataset has been preprocessed and the features have been extracted, a machine learning algorithm can be trained on the data to identify patterns and relationships between the features and user preferences.
The algorithm used for content-based recommendation is cosine similarity, which calculates the similarity between the features of a given movie and the features of other movies in the dataset.

After the model has been trained, it can be used to recommend movies to users based on the features of the movies they have enjoyed in the past. 
For example, if a user has indicated a preference for action movies, the model can recommend other action movies
The model is then deployed using Heroku.
